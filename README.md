Our latest venture into innovation saw significant enhancements on our VCB (Vehicle Control Board), since testing and implementation of previous revisions displayed a need to expand functionality and fix issues.

We tackled UART communication with our Bluetooth module head-on, implementing hardware changes that ensured seamless connectivity and reliability. We also revamped the layout of components on our boards to prevent any short circuits during rigorous testing phases. With precision manufacturing from JLCPCB, we're confident in the durability and resilience of our designs. The last thing added was input circuitry for processing wheel speed sensor data, opening up a whole new set of doors for us to explore different vehicle dynamics and implement Traction Control and Launch Control!

Over the past 5 years we have sourced our PCBs through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/HAR). As designs for the car change often, we need a supplier who can react with our needs and supply PCBs on short notice so we can get back to testing and racing. We are grateful for the support of JLC in the production of our racecar!
